If you want to take your privacy to the next level, you can connect to a VPN before starting the Tor browser. The VPN will not be able to see what you’re doing in the Tor browser, and you’ll get the added benefit that no Tor node will be able to see your IP address. It will also prevent your network operators from even knowing that you are using Tor, which is helpful if the Tor Network happens to be blocked where you are.
