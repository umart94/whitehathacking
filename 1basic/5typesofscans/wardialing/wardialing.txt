take whole block of telephone numbers , see if there is a modem there.

lots of enterprises and service providers use modems for out-of-band network communication with their infrastructure.

if there is a critical error that causes those networking systems to fail
they have a way to communicate with them, even though it will be slow and we have to have a modem ourselves.

modern systems do not have modems installed.

however
there is still use in doing war dialing..
