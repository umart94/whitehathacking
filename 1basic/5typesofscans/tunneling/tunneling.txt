taking a piece of data

and stuffing it in another piece of data

in going through the tunnel we cannot be seen
we would have to be inside the tunnel to view the data.

data that we are sending we do not want that to be seen
restrictions on the network
firewalls - that prevent data from entering or exiting 

we need tunnels for data to go through

go to localhost on the other side using port 2300 and dest port 23. on localhost.
ssh user@IP -L2300:localhost:23

telnet localhost 2300


sudo ssh user@IP -L23:localhost:23

since we are using standard port, we need sudo privileges.

httptunnel package.
