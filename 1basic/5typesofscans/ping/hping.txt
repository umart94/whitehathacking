hping used for crafting packets.

use evasive tactics to get around intrusion detection systems and firewalls and network intrusion protection systems.

sudo hping3 -h

tcp mode
raw ip mode - modify any sort of ip packet
icmp mode
udp mode
spoof source address
time to live value
set an identification

split packets into fragments
set source port and destination ports
set window size.

sudo hping3 192.168.100.1 -U -S -s 55355 -d 8080

-U - Urgent flag
-S SYN flag

-s source port

-d destination port.

can potentially avoid firewalls
used to run on systems that are vulnerable to these type of attacks. ( where malformed packets can run on network )

we can use PackETH to generate a ethernet packet ( edit its properties )

Link layer
vlan tag - 802.1q vlan fields
specify next layer is ipv4 ipv6 arp packet or user defined packet

change ip version


we can change the protocol values
change all of the ip headers.

next layer tcp
source port
destination port

set flags

URG
PSH
SYN

set tcp payload
set pattern
set length
apply pattern

save a packet
restore it later.
