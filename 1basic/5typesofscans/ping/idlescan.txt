we use a system that is not doing anything in network activity
we bounce network traffic off this idle system

to determine whether ports are open or not.

target system is going to reply to the idle system
we can see the ip headers whether it has incremented or not incremented.

sudo nmap -Pn -sI 192.168.100.1(idle) 192.168.100.22(target)

sudo nmap -sX 192.168.1.22(target)

sudo nmap -sF 192.168.1.22(target)
