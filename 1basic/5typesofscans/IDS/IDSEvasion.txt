detect types of activities we are engaged in

work on a target where activities arent known and shouldnt be known by operations people involved in operating and managing the network

technical control, operational procedures, systems are working

evade detection from an ids

eg. use packeth tcp and udp we are not going to see a response back
responses will go to source ip

in addition to spoofing, change how packets look by changing type of service, fragment offsets, packet flag settings that may allow us through IDS and firewall.
without detection



use packeth to generate a lot of bogus data

hide in the noise generated by packeth.


use nmap
set throttle
timing to go really slow..

it may not rise to threshold that will get detected by ids


add decoys into a scan

nmap will throw decoys into the scan

data lengths
ttl
spoof mac addresses with bogus checksums.

downsides :

we run the risk of slowing down work - side effect of approach of hiding ourself 
if we have a limited timeframe. we can use these techniques.
be aware how long these techniques will take




spoof technique - throttle of 5 - throw bogus traffic to target.
