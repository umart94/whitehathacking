banner is any message that application provides
networked applications provide :
message - indicating type of service running on a port on that server.

telnet 192.168.100.136 22

if i type this
it gives us a message displaying the ssh version used by the OS


connect on port 80 web server responds on well known ports


telnet client - server

server used to provide console access to remote users
client used to connect to systems running telnet as a server
good app for doing a tcp connection

telnet 192.168.100.136 22

connect to ports
interact with them manually using get request.

nc -v www.domain.com 80

dig mx domain.com



sudo netcat -v -z -n -w 1 1.2.3.4 1-1023


sudo nc -v mail.google.com 25
DNS fwd/rev mismatch: googlemail.l.google.com != someaddress

They do match, google (and most large providers) have an abstraction for load balancing, the destination/ip of gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com. changes depending on your requesting ip, the health of the network, the load, etc.

however the IP address has a forwarder && reverse dns (FCrDNS)

dig gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com. +short
74.125.29.26

26.29.125.74.in-addr.arpa. 15995 IN     PTR     qg-in-f26.1e100.net.

dig qg-in-f26.1e100.net. +short
74.125.29.26
However, none of this "matters" for Inbound MX Records, only sending IPs.
