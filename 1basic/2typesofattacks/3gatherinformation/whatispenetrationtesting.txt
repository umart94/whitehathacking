testing to see whether we can break into a server or application
involves social engineering
technical approach
physical access.


goals
assess weakness in a security posture
understand risk position better
accessing systems to find weaknesses

results
report detailing findings
should include remediation activities to fix vulnerabilities.

Scope

How big is the bread box ?
Any exclusions? any areas of no-touch ?
Must get sign off from target organization
always get approval from the RIGHT people.

Security Assessment 

hand in hand approach
goal isnt to penetrate but to fully assess risk
provide more detail about fixes
may look at process issues in addition to technical issues
review policies where appropriate.

Comprehensive

security assessment may look at more factors to assess the security posture and overall risk

penetration testing may provide unrealistic view - if no penetration in a week
organization may feel like they are secure.
