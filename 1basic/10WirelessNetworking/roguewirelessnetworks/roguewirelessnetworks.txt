wifi explorer.

enterprise networks
1. someone brings access point close to access points in an enterprise.

circumvent a wireless access policy ( LOL !! )


2. get an access point(rogue), and make it look similiar to another access point..
copying authentication for the network
and instead of the actual wireless point the rogue wireless network point shows up.


risks:
whether it looks identical enough or not
possibility of being detected

3. get the legitimate access point offf the air by DoS

4. make an access point in a public place with no security.

5. set mobile hotspot - your computer as a wifi access point as attacker.
