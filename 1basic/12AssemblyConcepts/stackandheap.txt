Stack Heap are 2 different ways of storing information in memory


low memory 00000
TEXT SEGMENT - PROGRAM RESIDES , EXECUTABLE CODE
DATA SEGMENT - ANY DATA we know about during compile time , global values
HEAP - memory that is dynamically allocated.. malloc

STACK FRAME - CHUNK OF MEMORY that works in this way

when we run a program, stack frames are put in stack.
STACK IS GOING TO START at the highest point in memory
and grow towards the low memory.

STACK GROWS TOWARDS HEAP
HEAP GROWS TOWARDS STACK


so we put a stack frame on stack when we run the program

stack frame consists of

Function Local Vars
Base Pointer - points to bottom of the stack
Return Pointer - instruction pointer, instruction where we have to jump back to
Calling Parameters - calling parameters to that function

in stack frame we have attacks like buffer overflow and format string attacks.







high memory fffff
