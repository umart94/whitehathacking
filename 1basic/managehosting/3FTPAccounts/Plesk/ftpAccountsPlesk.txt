this plesk domain hosting website has 2 panels
1 for controlling domain
1 for controlling plesk


to configure ftp, we have to enter the plesk control panel

to go to the plesk control panel, go to the port domainname.com:8443

first, we have to configure the ftp account through ftp access panel

and then we have to configure the directory for ftp using file manager.

there is a folder here called httpdocs , which is where we can put all the files that can be accessed by a browser.

just like public html folder

here we need to create the client directory inside the httpdocs folder.
