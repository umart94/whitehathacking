download an ftp client like filezilla on windows and cyberduck on macs

note that not all servers support SFTP. , although it is more secure.
ftps has issues with firewalls and certificates.

website root goes to httpdocs folder, or public html folder

different hosts have different names for this folder.

when we will connect to client folder through ftp
client can only see 1 folder ( whatever folder he has access to)
he cannot view the public server directory.
