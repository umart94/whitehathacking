when accessing documents on the server, we can use these type of links :

absolute
root relative
relative references


whenever we go to a domain, it goes to a document called default document.
usually this document is called index.html

if there is no index.html
the server will display an error page or some default test page.



1. Absolute Reference

http://website.com/images/computer.jpg
domain name of the website followed by image location

used when linking to websites outside our website.


disadvantages:

will only work when we are online.
also , if the domain name of website changed, then this link would break and wont work.




2. Root Relative Reference
Root Relative reference

<img src="/images/computer.jpg" alt="a computer" />

look for this file starting from the root directory.
so root directory has an images directory that has the jpg file.


used when there are a lot of folders with complex structures. so the links are consistent.






3. Relative References
in folder we have index.html and upcoming folder
we have upcoming folder, inside which there is shows.html

in index.html , we create a link

<a href="upcoming/shows.html">

this is called a relative link, as it is linking to the shows.html page in relation to the index.html page.



another type of relative reference is that :

in folder we have index.html and upcoming folder
we have upcoming folder, inside which there is shows.html

shows.html has this tag :

<img src="../images/computer.jpg" alt="abcd" />

images folder is one directory above the page that is referencing this  /images/computer.jpg
i.e in the root folder

so relation of images folder to upcoming folder is one directory up and then images. , typed with ../



when website has a lot of folders, using relative links becomes difficult.
