when we go to a web address like lynda.com or bluehost.com

we are connecting to a web server that sends files stored on its hard drive

how did files get there ?

the files can be sent to a server using a protocol called ftp which stands for file transfer protocol

in order to send files to a server using ftp we have to create a default ftp account on a domain
and perhaps create a new ftp account so that the clients can send us files.

we can add a new ftp account
or use the default account

we can configure ftp client
we can setup coniguration files.

a master ftp account has access to all of the folders
but we can limit the client access by typing folder names here

this client will only have access to the folder named "clients" inside the public_html folder.

public_html is a folder where we place all of the files that will be accessible by a browser
