data base are part of your server, but are created in a seperate host.
we connect to a seperate host to connect to the database

we can create a blog folder on our host
and paste the wordpress files to that folder ( if we want wordpress to run as a blog)

or else copy the entire folder to the root folder. ( if we want wordpress to manage our domain)


wp-config-sample.php

change it to wp-config.php

in this file we will type the login credentials that we receive from our web host.
when we created the database.


from there we can type the information about the wordpress username
this information will be then stored in the mysql database on the domain webhost.

( the information we wrote in the wp-config.php) file.
