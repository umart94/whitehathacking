we may need to create webmail and email addresses 

mail forward

mail forward is an email address that doesnt get any email sent to this address
but it will be forwarded to an inbox that you specify.

e.g we create info@domain.com
and our admin user is umar@domain.com

so we forward all mail sent to info@domain.com to umar@domain.com

if we send an email to info@domain.com
and choose the option Discard with error to sender ( at SMTP Time )

it will not forward the mail, and instead use a default failure message specified by us. and send this to the client.
