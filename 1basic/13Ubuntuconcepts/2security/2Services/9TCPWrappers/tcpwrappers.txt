sudo apt-get install tcpd

tcp wrappers is designed to wrap a service program
we might use this for telnet, ftp, or a service
that does not have its own management for access management.

i.e which users can access which service in which configuration mode.


for e.g : only allow telnet on local network.


hosts.allow file,
in etc directory
WHITELIST = hosts.allow


hosts.deny file,
blacklist,
denying access.

if nothing is in these files, we grant access.

allow some
deny everything else.
