controlled by a number of service config files
character generator - chargen
datetime
discard echo
ftpd
time
etc.

ftpd - run out of internet super server

cat ftpd


we will create the config files here in this folder /etc/xinetd.d

this config file will know which port to use through /etc/services

umartariq@umartariq:/etc$ cat xinetd.conf
# Simple configuration file for xinetd
#
# Some defaults, and include /etc/xinetd.d/

defaults
{

# Please note that you need a log_type line to be able to use log_on_success
# and log_on_failure. The default is the following :
# log_type = SYSLOG daemon info

}

includedir /etc/xinetd.d





so xinetd.conf in etc is the main config file
it includes all the other config files inside xinetd.d folder..


we can create the ftp config file, set the settings and then set the server which will be used.

provides echo service


the services file is used to determine the service port

and rest of the configuration is how to run that service

super service is 1 service that runs multiple services

1 program that manages all of the listening and communications
and passes them to service program.
