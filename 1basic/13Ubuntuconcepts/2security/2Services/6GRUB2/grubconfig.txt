if anyone can access the grub file

the password is in plaintext

we should avoid this..


grub-mkpassword-pbkdf2

this asks us for a password

generates a string , that we can use in our file.
encrypts the password set in grub config for
the superuser.


uses a hash algorithm for e.g sha 512

sudo nano /etc/grub.d/00_header

if we type some wrong password
then what we can do is use another password
for superusers

and while checking the wrong password, we can default back to the plaintext one.

and when the hashed password works.
then remove the plaintext passwords from the grub config file.
