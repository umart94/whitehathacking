/etc/systemd

has the configuration files.

rather than runlevels , we have targets

graphical target
multiuser target

they are all equivalent to some runlevel.

for e.g graphical target equivalent to runlevel 5.

multi user target eq. to run level 3.

sudo systemctl get-default

sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target.



set default to be multi user target

sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target


THIS WILL SET DEFAULT ! so rather than doing this

what we can do is to test it

sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target



to switch back

sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target
