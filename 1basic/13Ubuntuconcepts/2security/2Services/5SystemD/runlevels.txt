ways of grouping services together
we get services we want

ls /etc/rc*

rc0

shutting the machine down
starting the machine.

run level 1
single user mode


we start by adding additional services as we go up the levels.

until we get all the way upto run level 5

which is full GUI  plus network interface..

ls /etc/rc*

rc6 is actually reboot


S and K

these are links.

ls -la /etc/rc3.d

links to startup scripts that are in etc/init.d

if it says S that is a startup script.


run level 0 has K scripts

these are when the system is shutting down

they run in ascii order

K01
K10

k01 runs before k10

how to determine what run level we are in ?



less /etc/inittab

Back in the days the "System-V" init service was used in Ubuntu, and it used the /etc/inittab file.

Some time ago (around 2006) the "Upstart" init service replaced SysV. During these days you could follow the top answer and use man inittab to get info on this change.

At the time of writing (e.g. for Ubuntu 16.04) the "systemd" boot process is in use and there is no reference left to "inittab" (e.g. if you do apropos inittab you'll probably not find anything). Instead you could do man runlevel to get similar information.

Bottom line: the /etc/inittab file is nowhere, likely because you use a newer version for Ubuntu that has a different init service, e.g. systemd
