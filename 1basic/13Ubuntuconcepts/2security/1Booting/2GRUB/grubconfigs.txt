there are alphabetical files..

so for e.g 00_header file

has scripts

these scripts , tell us the actual config file for grub

sudo grub-mkconfig

make config is going to take all config files
generate a single configuration file

that config file is in /boot/grub

this grub.cfg is actually a script
instead of a configuration file..
