localdns server

local traffic , local lookups

we can use public resolvers

cat /etc/resolv.conf

dynamic resolv.conf file for glibc resolver. 

nameserver
search localdomain

set to automatic dhcp 

set it to addresses only automatic dhcp

then in dns servers add our own dns server.

this will get inserted into resolv.conf

so we can use public dns servers.
