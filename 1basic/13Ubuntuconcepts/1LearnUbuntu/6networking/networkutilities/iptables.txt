linux firewall
recent version of linux firewall

before it was called ipchains


sudo iptables -L -v
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination  
 
 
 groups things into chains and tables
 default policy is accept or default policy drop
 
 accept anything that comes in
 
 we could append a rule
 
 sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
 
  sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP
  
  we can do network address translation
  forwarding
  drop and accept rules
  flush everything out of iptables and start from scratch
  
  sudo iptables -F INPUT
  sudo iptables -L -v
