provides better security.
bind different hard drives together to create one larger drive ( using mirroring)

create a mirrored raid set.

can be done using mdadm

sudo mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=0 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1

sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0

filesystem written out
mount it and start writing data

mirrored set by using 2 seperate partitions.
seperate partitions on two different hard drives

any data that is written to this is going to be written to both.

if 1 of the devices fails, we still have data on 1 device.

this can be done upto a large number of RAID levels.
