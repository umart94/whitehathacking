this gives ubuntu system ability to log on a network, syslog messages coming from other devices.


with syslog we have facilities and levels
auth , authpriv facility - facility is being logged to var/log/auth.log

for different levels ,we can set different logging based on facility.

cd /
cd var
cd log

sudo nano kern.log
sudo nano syslog1,2,3 etc

program called log rotate, that rotates the logs periodically.
we can keep multiple weeks or days worth of log files.

older ones get zipped up and compressed.
