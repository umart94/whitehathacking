tar xjpf nmap-7.80.tar.bz2


This is the traditional compile-it-yourself format. The Nmap tarball compiles under Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, and many UNIX platforms (Solaris, Free/Net/OpenBSD, etc.) It includes Zenmap, the GUI frontend.

Detailed Linux/BSD/Solaris compilation instructions and options are provided here, though this usually does the trick:

bzip2 -cd nmap-7.80.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -
cd nmap-7.80
./configure
make
su root
make install


make sure that ./configure does not give any errors like " XYZ package not found "

then install those packages
i had to install
gcc
and 
libpcap

then run ./configure again

The configure script is asking for the location of the OpenSSL library headers and *.so files, not the openssl executable. On Ubuntu/Debian systems, you can install these headers by installing the libssl-dev package. If you install it this way, you do not have to provide the location to the configure script; it will find it on its own.


sudo apt-get libssl-dev

Configured without: localdirs ndiff zenmap nmap-update


check the option
download source in software and update

after that

run the command

sudo apt-get build-dep nmap

  python3-distutils zlib1g-dev


these are dependencies for nmap


sudo apt-get build-dep nmap

so this command installed all the dependencies for us

now we can run ./configure again

sudo apt-get install git wget build-essential checkinstall libpcre3-dev libssl-dev libpcap-dev

now run ./configure again


/configure --with-localdirs


sudo apt install python3-pip



It was removed from the repository due to relying on Python 2 which reached End-of-Life at the start of 2020. You can install Zenmap manually from 19.10 repository:

mkdir -p ~/Downloads/zenmap
cd ~/Downloads/zenmap

wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/pygtk/python-gtk2_2.24.0-6_amd64.deb
wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/n/nmap/zenmap_7.80+dfsg1-1build1_all.deb

sudo apt install ./*.deb
and enjoy.

Note: I have filed bug-report launchpad as https://pad.lv/1876269 with packaging request.

The GitHub issue tracker for porting Zenmap to Python 3 can be found here.
