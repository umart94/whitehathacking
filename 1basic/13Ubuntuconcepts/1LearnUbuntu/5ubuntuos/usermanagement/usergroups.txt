groups have permissions that cascade down to the users

sudo nano /etc/group


our user is added to some other groups

that means that all the rights and permissions these groups have , we also have.

sudo groupadd testgroup

sudo groupmod -g 5000 testgroup

system uses groupid and sets permissions with that numeric value.
