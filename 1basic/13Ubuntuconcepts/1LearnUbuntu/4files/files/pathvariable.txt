path variable is where we would look for executable running paths.

echo $PATH

if system needs to look for a program then it would look in these directories.

export PATH=$PATH:~/bin
echo $PATH

export PATH=/usr/local/games:/home/umartariq/bin

export is a built in function of the shell

export PATH=/bin:/usr/local/games:~/bin


if executable is not in the path it will not run.

./ls

. is current directory slash is also current directory.

/usr/bin/clear
