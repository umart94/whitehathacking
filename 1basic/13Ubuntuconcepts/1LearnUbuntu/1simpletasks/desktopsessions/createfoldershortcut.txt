ln -s $PWD ~/Desktop/

For Application Shortcuts:
I think TheBuntuNewb's answer is pretty good. Do that using file manager:

Open /usr/share/applications
Copy the application shortcut to desktop
Right click on the shortcut on the desktop and select Allow Launching
For Folder/File shortcuts:
Either directly use the terminal to create a symbolic link

ln -s <complete path to dir> <shortcut save location>
or

Open the folder in the file manager (nautilus), navigate to the directory to which you want to create a shortcut to.

Right click and select Open in Terminal.

For shortcut to current directory, type and execute

ln -s $PWD ~/Desktop/
For shortcut to a file/folder inside the current directory, type and execute

ln -s $PWD/filename ~/Desktop/
or

ln -s $PWD/dirname ~/Desktop/
