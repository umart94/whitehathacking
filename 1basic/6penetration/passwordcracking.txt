hashsuite for windows


on kali linux

sudo unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > mypasswd


[sudo] password for kali: 
Created directory: /root/.john

in password cracking

we have a wordlist of potential passwords
we go through creating a password from the wordlist
do a cryptographic hash of the word
if they match , we obtain the match for hash and obtain password.


sudo john --wordlist=rockyou.txt mypasswd
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 2 password hashes with 2 different salts (sha512crypt, crypt(3) $6$ [SHA512 128/128 AVX 2x])
Cost 1 (iteration count) is 5000 for all loaded hashes
Will run 4 OpenMP threads
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status


this can run for days and days

so we can use rainbow tables

these are pre computed hash tables and values.


ophcrack - windows password cracker - uses rainbow tables.
