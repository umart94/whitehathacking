get a user to perform a function on web application without them being aware of it

get for post

actually sending data to the server , using a get request rather than a post request.


get request in an image tag
image wont show
and user will generate a request for the server where this is loaded.
image tag generates a get request.
image wont be there

do something on the server without our knowledge.
