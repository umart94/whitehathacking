dhcp makes it easy to add systems to a network
in large enterprises we use dhcp

in linux its a service
we can configure the dhcp conf file.


cd /etc/dhcp
cat dhcpd.conf
less dhcpd.conf

ISC provides dhclient, and as such, it serves as sort of a reference. The more lightweight dhcpcd is somewhat more up to date. Both dhcpcd and dhclient are fully capable DHCP client daemons. Dhclient is not a "one-time" utility:

man dhclient

-w Continue running even if no broadcast interfaces were found. Normally DHCP client will exit if it isn't able to identify any network interfaces to configure. (...)

That is more like the default behavior of dhcpcd.

DHCP has been kind of a moving target, with various vendors (Microsoft in particular) introducing various deviations from the standard.

in our case we have "dhcpclient" file.

we can configure the search order.
hostname
domain name
we can also configure domain name servers.

we dont have to configure dns servers for every machine.

#send dhcp-lease-time 3600;

the default lease time has to do with the amount of time we are allowed to keep an ip address before we have to go back to the server
we need that ip address.
allow us to keep that ip address.

shorter lease time means we are constantly talking to the dhcp server.
until that lease time expires, we have that ip address, after that we may not have that ip address


kali@kali:/etc/dhcp$ cat dhclient.conf
# Configuration file for /sbin/dhclient.
#
# This is a sample configuration file for dhclient. See dhclient.conf's
#       man page for more information about the syntax of this file
#       and a more comprehensive list of the parameters understood by
#       dhclient.
#
# Normally, if the DHCP server provides reasonable information and does
#       not leave anything out (like the domain name, for example), then
#       few changes must be made to this file, if any.
