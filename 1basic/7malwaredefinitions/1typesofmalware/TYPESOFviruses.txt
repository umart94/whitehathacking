signature
look for the signature


3. multipartite virus


4. macros

5. polymorphic viruses - code mutations so the signature changes everytime 
by using zeus - we can install webfilters and webfakes - by code mutations.


so these viruses will restrict your visiting of websites.

metamorphic virus rewrites itself everytime it gets infected.
it would look different in all of those infected files
