analysis of files and urls - virustotal



strings command will find ascii strings and print them


so strings infectedfile.exe

will show its details

at the bottom it will show the dll files that the exe file is using.
xml definition ( assembly )


sometimes this can show where the file has come from , external libraries 

PEiD is a software that will show :

Entrypoint
File Offset
Linker Info
EP Section
First Bytes
Subsystem

these will tell whether an original exe file has been hacked or not.

for packers the EP Section shows UPX1.


text file has a single data stream that is the text in the text file in windows. 1 single stream for 1 file.

Alternate data streams means multiple pieces of data in different streams attached to 1 single file..

multiple file systems supported by windows

so windows created this for resource fork supports in apple file systems. 


resource fork exists solely for storing resources like icons e.g or other resources required by applications

user wont get to see them or manipulate them directly.

apple has resource forks
windows has alternate data streams

create an alternate data stream

type a.txt

type a.exe > a.txt:a.exe

start .\a.txt:a.exe


we would need to get data into stream

then get data back out from stream to make a virus executable file.
