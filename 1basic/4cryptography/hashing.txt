hashing is a one way function
no ability to get back the original data.

fixed length values generated.
this should have no relation at all to the original data.

we hash passwords

cleartext passwords are not saved.

hash password - same value back is returned

generate hashes against a list of words until we match a password inside a file.
so we know what a password is. ( of a file )


but since it can be computed we also use salt.
