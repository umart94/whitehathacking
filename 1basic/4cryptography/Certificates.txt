a certificate is a digital piece of data that tells who we really are
it gives us the ability to encrypt messages.

used in encrypted websites, using https connection, we are using a certificate.

server offers a certificate to us,


step1: generate a certificate authority. , Private Key.


Data gets encrypted with the public key, and decrypted with the private key.. , they are mathematically linked.


openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 4096


Step2: openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt

STEP3 : openssl x509 -text -in ca.crt

self signed certificate.

encryption
does not give us validation - does not give non repudiation.

certificate authority has its own certificate. - this is what we generated in step2.

the certificate for a user is signed with this certificate for CA

that CA certificate ( what the CA certificate would send to the user , which is its public certificate ) is then installed anywhere its going to be used.

example are the certificate authorities in the browser.
