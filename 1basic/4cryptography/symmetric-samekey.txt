in symmetric encryption , we use the same key
it is faster than asymmetric encryption
we can use algorithms like aes, des.


download aescrypt from website.
gunzip AESCrypt-GUI-3.11-Linux-x86_64-Install.gz

Install Directory:
            /usr/share/aescrypt

    Setup Type:
            Typical
			
touch text.txt
echo 'This is a test' > data.txt

cat > text.txt
then type text
and exit


aescrypt -e -p supersecretpassword a.txt
this will generate a.txt.aes file ( encrypted file)

aescrypt -d -p supersecretpassword a.txt.aes


this is symmetric key encryption to encrypt a file
it uses either stream or block ciphers.

block - fixed length block - 64 bits encrypted at a time. ( if less number of bits , fill it with padding bits )

stream - 


Asymmetric - uses two different keys - public key and private key
uses longer key length
longer process
slower encryption

use is for signing documents or emails - private key signs something, public key verifies signature.

who you got the file from is who sent it.
decrypt and encrypt messages.
