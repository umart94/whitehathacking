manual testing of apps
dradis creates a ruby on rails server.

Bundler provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed.

Bundler is an exit from dependency hell, and ensures that the gems you need are present in development, staging, and production. Starting work on a project is as simple as bundle install.


cd dradis-ce/

Run the following in your command line:
$ ./bin/setup
if we run it like this, it will be installed for non super users as well
if we run with sudo , it will require admin privilieges.




bundle install

The git source https://github.com/dradis/dradis-calculator_cvss.git is not yet checked out. Please run `bundle install` before trying to start your
